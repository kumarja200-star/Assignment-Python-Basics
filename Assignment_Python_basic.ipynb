        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - python is a dynamically typical object oriented programming language that people use to tell computers what to do.\n",
        "      *  Versatile\n",
        "      *  Python is simple and easy\n",
        "      *  Big community\n",
        "      *  Lots of libraries\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        " - A Python code, the computer doesn’t directly understand it because computers only understand machine language (0s and 1s).\n",
        "The Python interpreter reads your code line by line, translates it into a language the computer understands, and makes it run immediately.   \n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        " -  Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that Python has already reserved for specific purposes.You cannot use them as variable names or function names because Python already uses them to understand certain commands.\n",
        "   Ex: if, else, for, while, True, False, class, def\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        " - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "Because keywords have a special meaning in Python, if you try to use them as variable names, Python will get confused and show an error.\n",
        "Ex:wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        " - Mutability in Python means whether something can be changed after it is created.It Can be changed you can modify its content without creating a new one.EX:list, dict, set → you can add, remove, or update items.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " - Lists are mutable because Python allows you to change their contents (add, remove, or update items) after creating them.\n",
        "Tuples are immutable because Python locks their contents — once created, you cannot change, add, or remove anything inside them.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        " - == (equal to) → Checks if the values are the same.\n",
        "is (identity) → Checks if two things are actually the same object in memory.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "print(a == b)  # True\n",
        "print(a is b)  # False\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        " - Logical operators in Python are special words that connect or combine conditions and give a True or False result.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        " - Type casting in Python means changing one type of data into another type.\n",
        "    Ex: changing a number into a string, or a string into a number.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        " - Type casting means changing data from one type to another, and it happens in two ways.\n",
        "    *  Implicit → Python changes it by itself.\n",
        "       Explicit → You change it on purpose.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        " - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to let your program make decisions and run different code depending on conditions.\n",
        "   They check if something is True or False and then decide what to do next.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        " - It is used when you have more than two possible conditions to check.\n",
        "Python checks each condition in order, and as soon as it finds one that is True, it runs that block of code and skips the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        " -  for loop → Runs a fixed number of times.\n",
        "    while loop → Runs until a condition becomes False.\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        " - A while loop is more suitable when you don’t know in advance how many times you’ll need to repeat something — you just keep going until a certain condition is met.\n",
